# Network Science - 6520 - SF_Bike_Share
Created by Jacob Martin 

Description: 
This github will serve as the hosting location for my coursework for the DSBA 6520 Network Science course at the University of North Carolina @ Charlotte.  The course project is to use network science tools and analysis to analyze a dataset.  The dataset chosen comes from Kaggle.com and deals with bike share data in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Note the data has been slimmed down to be for values during 2015 to help lower computational requirements.  This creates an 8 month period to work with between January and August. 

*** If loading the R Markdown and project ensure you unzip the data and place it in the data folder

Files: 
* Project_Proposal1.pdf - Contains the data graph and an introduction to the purose of the project
* Project_Proposal2.pdf - Updated version and includes the graph data algorithms and queries
* BikeShare_RProj - Folder containing the work done in R to produce visualizations, profiling of data, and cleaning steps
* Neo4j_Setup_Script - Instructions in order to load the data from the zip files labeled for neo4j.  Everything was slimmed down significantly to enable Neo to create the network structure
